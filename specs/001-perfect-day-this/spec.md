# Feature Specification: Perfect Day Sharing App

**Feature Branch**: `001-perfect-day-this`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Perfect Day
This is an app to share a perfect plan for a day with people

The persona is Kouta, who is a 29 year old man living in Tokyo. He wants to share a perfect day by sharing a narrative and a timeline of what happened on the day with the information like area, restaurant visited, transportation used, people hung out with, hotel stayed at, etc. Other people can plan their perfect day by looking at what he has shared.

## User stories

### 001: Kouta is able to create a perfect day to share
- He can create a title of the day
- He can create a summary description of the day
- He can pick the main areas he spent time in
- He can share where he went by Google Business Profile of a place. If the place does not own a Google Business Profile, he can type free text.
- He can share his comment on each activity
- He can share the time spent on each activity"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Kouta, a 29-year-old Tokyo resident, wants to document and share his perfect day experiences to inspire others in planning their own perfect days. He creates detailed day plans that include places visited, activities done, time spent, and personal commentary, which other users can browse for inspiration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Kouta has experienced a great day, **When** he creates a new perfect day entry, **Then** he can add a title and summary description
2. **Given** Kouta is documenting his day, **When** he adds locations he visited, **Then** he can search for places via Google Business Profile or enter custom text for places without profiles
3. **Given** Kouta is adding activities to his day, **When** he documents each activity, **Then** he can specify the time spent and add personal comments
4. **Given** Kouta has completed his perfect day documentation, **When** other users browse the app, **Then** they can view his shared day plan with all details
5. **Given** a user is viewing Kouta's perfect day, **When** they want to plan their own day, **Then** they can see the timeline, locations, and activities for reference

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a Google Business Profile search returns no results?
- How does the system handle activities without specific locations?
- What happens when time spent on activities overlaps or has gaps in the timeline?
- How are private vs public sharing preferences handled?
